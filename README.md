## Description
This application gives users access to Top Rated coffee shops within the greater Sacramento Area. The ratings reflect user 'non-negotiables,' such as Wifi/work space, variety of food and beverage, and parking convenience.

Once users search by zip code, they are matched with a list of 10 coffee shops, an interactive map, and previous reviews from the Collective database. Users are encouraged to provide feedback each time they visit a new location. This data is linked to Firebase for persistent data storage, sorted, and displayed in the Review Section using Chart.js.

Each review strengthens the Collective (ratings), providing users a more streamlined list of coffee shops&work spaces in the future. 

Development goals for the app include: creating a user login, implementing a communication board for users to display meet-ups or professional mixers, and extending the beta roll-out to other metropolitan cities.
